# Bus-pass
Bus Pass Management System that digitizes the traditional process of issuing and managing bus passes, solving the problem of standing in long lines. The system allows users, such as students or employees, to apply for bus passes online, eliminating the need for physical queues and paperwork.

The project uses HTML and CSS for creating a responsive and user-friendly front-end interface where users can easily register, submit their details, and check the status of their bus pass. The backend is powered by PHP, which handles user requests and processes applications, while MySQL is used for storing user data, such as personal details, pass validity, and routes, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

This digital solution improves user convenience, reduces manual errors, and supports the transition to a paperless, faster process for bus pass issuance.
